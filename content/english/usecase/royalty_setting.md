The copyright and neighboring right royalty is the wage-like earning of the music performer, the composer and producer. In popular music performers usually play their own composition and sing their own lyrics. If the musician is self-published, all the three royalties directly pay the artist’s work. If a professional publisher is helping the artist as a composer, or a record producer as a recorded performer, they usually share the respective royalty revenues. In emerging markets fewer, in mature markets more composers are represented by publishers and performers by record labels. 


## International Comparisons

The CEEMID international comparison models are based on the implicit econometric model set out in the [AKKA/LAA vs Konkurences padome case](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?language=en&num=C-177/16)  which goes far beyond the regional comparison suggested by the earlier Czech [Léčebné lázně Mariánské Lázně v OSA case](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?&num=C-351/12).
