The copyright and neighboring right royalty is the wage-like earning of the music performer, the composer and producer. In popular music performers usually play their own composition and sing their own lyrics. If the musician is self-published, all the three royalties directly pay the artist’s work. If a professional publisher is helping the artist as a composer, or a record producer as a recorded performer, they usually share the respective royalty revenues. In emerging markets fewer, in mature markets more composers are represented by publishers and performers by record labels. 


## International Comparisons

The CEEMID international comparison models are based on the implicit econometric model set out in the [AKKA/LAA vs Konkurences padome case](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?language=en&num=C-177/16)  which goes far beyond the regional comparison suggested by the earlier Czech [Léčebné lázně Mariánské Lázně v OSA case](http://curia.europa.eu/juris/liste.jsf?&num=C-351/12). 

## Market Comparators

The best models are based on market data and use information on prices and quantities agreed by independent, arms-length contractual partners.  Our market comparator models process all collectively managed and estimated individually licensed uses of music and audiovisual content in a country. It is than possible to compare private copying values, value transfer to media platforms, or individual uses such as radio or television to the total market value of music listening per hour or film watching per hour.  These models require the most data input. 

We used such estimates in the Slovak Music Industry Report, in the calculation of private copying benefits to consumers and value transfer to YouTube in Hungary and Croatia.  

## Direct Estimates & Hypothetical Evaluations

Direct estimates are measuring quantities of unknown uses and they relate them to known market prices.  Hypothetical evaluations ask the willingness of users to pay for uses.  These models are easier to create, require less information, but they can be more easily challenged by regulators, licensees or auditors, because they do not rely only on independent and arms-length transaction data. 
## Hedonic Pricing

Hedonic price models are econometric price models that establish the residua value of music in complex services like hoteling or restaurant services.  We have used hedonic price modelling to establish the value of music use in the HORECA sector.  Technically these models could be used to evaluate the use in television or radio but the data requirements are extensive.
