# Biography

As a management consultant I apply a thoroughly professional approach based in economics, finance and data science. As a quantitatively trained financial economist, I use a variety of sound valuation methods, corporate finance models, forecasting tools and economic impact analysis for my recommendations, and I apply the standards and ethical guidelines of the Chartered Financial Analyst Institute.  My work is always supported by rich factual data, analyzed with advanced econometric, forecasting or predictive analytics tools, including machine learning.

I have a degree in economic regulation and competition policy, and I have used my knowledge in competition law-based inquiries both on the side of the authority and subject of the inquiry as a corporation; similarly, as a former railway regulator and as a consultant I have experience in setting, recommending or challenging regulated prices of various products, services or royalties.

As a data scientist, I work within the reproducible research framework. I create reports and presentations that can be independently audited, and which refresh all tables, recommendation texts and charts with the latest internal and external data using program scripts mainly written in the open source R language. I have many years of work experience with survey data, open data, and various in-house ERP system data, transactional data or expert decision support systems. I can work with  `R`,  `Python` or  `C++ ` code, and I have experience working in Windows, Mac, Linux or cloud environments. I can create automatically refreshing pdf, word, pptx reports, regulatory filings or job aids. You can find some of my open source code on [Github](https://github.com/antaldaniel), figures of [FigShare](https://figshare.com/authors/_/3739732) and datasets on the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/harvard?q=%28dvName%3ADaniel+dvName%3AAntal%29+OR+%28authorName%3ADaniel+authorName%3AAntal%29).

You can read more about my professional methods in the [Use cases](./usecase/) section that I will regularly updated in the future. I put various [publications](#publications) on this website and shorter remarks in blog [posts](#posts).  For a complete list of references, publications. You can find these clicking the top menus. For a complete list of references do not hesitate to [contact me](#contact).

And at last, my hobby is analogue photography.  I love to use cameras that are older than I am and shoot various format films that I can develop and print in a darkroom. If you share this passion with me, do not forget to check out the [Photography](#photography) section of this website.
