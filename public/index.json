The package creates a programmatic interface to compare economic impact changes in time, or compare any country with any country in the European Union.\nThe package is accompanied by three articles (or ‘vignettes’). The Germany 1990 re-creataes almost all of the practical examples of the Eurostat Manual of Supply, Use and Input-Output Tables by Jörg Beutel. This may be used as a tutorial to input-ouput analysis or understanding the package interface. Furthermore, it creates as a verification tool in the package testthat infrastructure to make sure that the functions correctly return all published, verified examples by Prof. Beutel.\nThe United Kingdom Input-Output Analyitcal Tables article similarly recreates the analytical results, such as GVA and employment cost effects for the United Kingdom 2010 table. While the current UK tables and standard Eurstat tables are somewhat different, this table is accompanied by Richard Wild’s excellent article and published analytical results.\nThe Working with Eurostat data article shows how to work with real-life, current, SNA2010 compatible data from the Eurostat data warehouse. It contains some comparative results between Czechia and Slovakia.

In individual rights managements, some of these techniques can be useful, but further methods can be used, because they are usually not limited to the same extent by competition law restrictions.\nCEEMID, the Central Eastern European Music Industry Database was set up after a memorandum was signed by several collective management entities and my former consulting company. Its main objective was to collect and organize data in a way that allows to calculate the economic value added of music and other relevant data for setting the price of music. CEEMID contains hundreds of indicators about music consumption, price, and related economic, sociocultural and consumption data.\nAppropirate benchmarks The jurisprudence of the Court of the European Union has touched upon music collective royalties with increasing frequency in the last decade. I believe that currently the most applicable case law is Autortiesību un komunicēšanās konsultāciju aģentūra/Latvijas Autoru apvienība v Konkurences padome, or shortly, AKKA/LAA vs Konkurences padome. A notable precursor to this decision the one made in the Czech case between the Czech collective management organization OSA and hotels, OSA v Léčebné lázně Mariánské Lázně.\nAccording the Court decision, significant differences between royalty prices on the European Single Market must be based on objective differences of economic, sociocultural factors and consumption habits. In the past 5 years, CEEMID has collected hundreds of economic, sociocultural consumption indicators to understand the differences of European markets in live music, recorded music, and in the important connecting markets of films, software games, restaurants, hotels, tv, radio and other big users of music.\nInternational comparison \u0026hellip;\nAdding original valuation An important problem with international comparison is that it will create a deadly vortex to the bottom if it is not applied in all territories, and no independent valuations are made. The international comparison is a benchmarking exercise at most, but it gives no direct valuation of music royalties. It is a very useful start, but it should be combined with true valuation.\nThe value of music, when used by business entities, such as radio stations, restaurants, or software game producers is based on the value in use, or the value added by combining music with some other service or product. A study commissioned by IFPI, the international record industry body, has enumerated several methods to value music in a study created by PWC.\n Analysing ‘comparable’ market outcomes is a very powerful tool, because it uses information that is most trusted by auditors and courts: market prices. The CEEMID full market model, powered by CEEMID indicators and nationally representative special consumer surveys, is very advanced application of the comparable market outcomes model, and it can be used to measure the value gap, set the value of private copying, or price collectively managed or individually managed royalties.\n Analysing the value music adds to businesses has an economic and a financial model. The financial model is not very useful in Central and Eastern Europe because of the lack of information, but the hedonic pricing economic model is a very powerful tool. We used it with CEE clients for setting restaurant and hotel tariffs.\n Analysing the behaviour and preferences of consumers leads to various experimental models, such as test screenings / hearings. They are widely used in the radio, film, television industry, and generally they are a very good tool for individual royalties. However, we also used them successfully to establish royalty tariffs for restaurants and department stores.\n  Which model to choose? In my experience, the best is to use as many as possible, because data limitations, and limitations of competition authorities or regulators to understand the models may not be foreseen. A good international comparison following the guidelines of the CJEU and at least two independent valuations usually wins the argument.\nAdding original valuation Documentation and data maintenance ","date":1546470000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546470000,"objectID":"12972acfcd81049e068ee2b4d261795f","permalink":"/usecase/royalty_setting/","publishdate":"2019-01-03T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/usecase/royalty_setting/","section":"usecase","summary":"The following steps apply to collective rights management, which is most of rights management in the Central, Eastern and Southern European markets.

Spotify pays out about 20% of its royalties to publishers. Because the labels are the bigger stakeholders, they often do not provide the necessary information for work identification in the case of publishers.\nDominic from Netflix is already one of the biggest buyers of music, and I believe that his company’s footprint will just continue growing.

There are many reasons for this, all a bit touched upon the other speaker’s issues, and their implementation difficulties n the CEE region, especially different revenue stream breakup, strong collective management and relatively underdeveloped publishing.

The presentation was largely based on analysis of various CEEMID databases.\nThe Central European music industry, as shown by processing the data of more than 2000 musicians in the region is even more reliant on live performances than the British music industry. Even though Croatia appears to be more similar to the UK than the region, a deeper analysis of the data reveals that this is not the case. The most important difference between mature markets and emerging markets is the lack of good distribution and monetization strategy for recorded music.\nCollecting and analyzing industry data is very important for small, national music industries that do not have a large enough repertoire that can be easily promoted on global platforms such as Spotify, Deezer or YouTube. New digital platforms produce relatively low income for Central and Southeastern European artists and labels, but they are growing at a rate similar to mature markets with a short, 1-5 years lag. Understanding the different strategies of global service providers, forthcoming liberalization and data-driven analytics are very important to maintain the share of domestic music in the radio and television channels and further expand it in the new channels.\nMore insights will be published on our blog and the forthcoming Regional music industry report.

This weakens Hungary’s national competitiveness while simultaneously lowering consumer spending on non-energy categories. By reviewing leading manufacturing-oriented, energy-dependent countries, it shows that Hungary’s problems are not a given. Germany uses less than half the amount of energy Hungary uses to create a single euro of GDP.
