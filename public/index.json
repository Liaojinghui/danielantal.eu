Previous work can be computationally intensive and is mainly based on low-level cues extracted from RGB data and implemented on a PC for a fixed sensor network (such as traditional CCTV). We present a practical and efficient framework for mobile devices (such as smart phones and robots) where high-level semantic soft biometrics are extracted from RGB and depth data. By combining these cues, our approach attempts to provide robustness to noise, illumination, and minor variations in clothing. This mobile approach may be particularly useful for the identification of persons in areas ill-served by fixed sensors or for tasks where the sensor position and direction need to dynamically adapt to a target. Results on the BIWI dataset are preliminary but encouraging. Further evaluation and demonstration of the system will be available on our website.","tags":[],"title":"A Person Re-Identification System For Mobile Devices","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Antal"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1372629600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372629600,"objectID":"38c215a6f98e9e0f06de89991d8e504f","permalink":"/publication/amchan_energy_2010/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/amchan_energy_2010/","section":"publication","summary":"It is AmCham’s view that Hungary does not have a consistent energy policy evaluation framework that would enable policymakers and investors to correctly establish priorities and create a roadmap towards energy security. In the current situation, Hungarians on average, both consumer and industrial, pay relatively more for their energy while using it less efficiently than their Western European counterparts. This weakens Hungary’s national competitiveness while simultaneously lowering consumer spending on non-energy categories. By reviewing leading manufacturing-oriented, energy-dependent countries, it shows that Hungary’s problems are not a given. Germany uses less than half the amount of energy Hungary uses to create a single euro of GDP. Japan has an excellent evaluation, planning and policy mix that resulted in exemplary energy savings in the past three decades. The Hungarian government can take a number of actions in the domestic economy to improve this situation, as well as initiate better co-operation regionally.","tags":["investments","environment","energy","regulation","Hungary"],"title":"AmCham Energy and Environment Committee published Position Brief","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Antal"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1372629600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372629600,"objectID":"8152c355fba581beeeaae19a799a55c5","permalink":"/publication/pcr_hungary_2013/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pcr_hungary_2013/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a mobile visual clothing search system whereby a smart phone user can either choose a social networking photo or take a new photo of a person wearing clothing of interest and search for similar clothing in a retail database. From the query image, the person is detected, clothing is segmented, and clothing features are extracted and quantized. The information is sent from the phone client to a server, where the feature vector of the query image is used to retrieve similar clothing products from online databases. The phone's GPS location is used to re-rank results by retail store location. State of the art work focuses primarily on the recognition of a diverse range of clothing offline and pays little attention to practical applications.
