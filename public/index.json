For comparison, we added a similar, middle-income emerging market (Argentina) and a rich, small-population English-speaking country, Australia to the chart. These countries seem to be in a similar position to the CEE countries.\n\r\r These findings will be open to discussion on Waves Music Showcase Festival and Conference [click for details] on 27 September 2019.\nArguably, the strongest countries of songwriting are the United States and Brazil - these are the countries that have ran out of the ISRC recording identifier range. Their charts are full with their domestic songs, but they are not alone. Japan, France, and the bigger EU countries, France, Germany and Poland have very strong domestic performance, too.\nOf course, there are many factor at play here. Large countries with large artist populations generate a lot more recordings, so they local fans always have thousands of new songs to select from. In small countries, the total annual creations, from pop to jazz, from authentic folk to classical amounts to a few thousand tracks. But it is not only size that matters. Sweden\u0026rsquo;s population is similar to that of Austria, Hungary and Czechia, yet the Swedish repertoire performs better in Sweden, and as we will see in the next chart, abroad, too.\nWe created a second chart to visualize how hits are travelling across the borders. To make the chart easier to read, we omitted the United States, Brazil and Japan as countries of origin, and concentrated only on intra-European hit flows.\nThe second week of September 2019 was not an exceptional week. Most EU countries\u0026rsquo; producers did not score any hits in any other EU countries\u0026rsquo; Spotify Top 50 hits. The UK exported many great hits to all over Europe, as usual, but there were other important hit flows. These hits mainly follow cultural proximity.\nFrance exported hits to the two Francophone countries of Europe, Belgium and Romania, and furthermore to Greece, a Southern country with particularly unique chart composition. Germany exported many hits to Austria, another German-speaking country, and some hits to other Germanic countries. Dutch producers placed a few hits in the Germanic countries and in Belgium, where the Dutch-speaking Flemish community has its own radios, TVs, press and hitlists. The Netherlands is a powerhouse of electronic popmusic that are not bound by language which finds audience in several countries.\nload ( file.path('plots', 'eu_charts_eu_share_plot_2019-09-15.rda') ) cross_border_plot  The strength and competitive position of the national market where an artists is most known and has a fan base is usually a determining factor of track performance and revenue. The overall revenue prospects and competition situation of a Hungarian or Croatian song is very different from a British or even a Polish song. But overall, most European recordings are not bound to a domestic country. Because of cultural proximity, the presence of native minorities or new immigrant diasporas, even small-language songs are being listened to on a much wider territory than the artists\u0026rsquo; original country. Some relatively small EU countries, such as Sweden and the Netherlands successfully export their music on a regular basis.\nNevertheless, as the streaming services slowly overtake all other forms of use, the charts above depict a very fundamental market change. Whereas in the traditional channels of physical sales, digital downloads and broadcasting, the CEE countries, like other small- and medium-sized EU countries, enjoyed 30-50% market share, among the streaming hits their producer\u0026rsquo;s share is below 10%. It is not unusual to find only domestic recordings in physical sales hitlists, while domestic songs rarely enter the streaming charts in the region, with the exception of Poland.\nThe traditional sales channels protected CEE markets in several ways. After EU accession most import duties are gone, but physical products have very significant logistics costs, which gives local producers a competitive edge. Because physical products are increasingly sold on concerts and festivals, where the market share of domestic performers is usually very high, the traditional, mechanically licensed sales had a protected market.\nThe broadcasting channel, which used the be the most important promotion channel, too, was protected in many European countries by national content quotas, or supported with generously funded national, regional, local public broadcasters who gave a preference to national composers, producers and performers. These market barriers are not present in the streaming markets, which poses many questions. Our research is aiming to answer these questions, but it took several years to build a data infrastructure that can help producing an accurate market overview.\n","date":1568968200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1568968200,"objectID":"bb057e812061d14807bc08f230d23b6b","permalink":"/post/cross_border_2019/","publishdate":"2019-09-20T10:30:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/cross_border_2019/","section":"post","summary":"Which are the European countries that can successfully export songs on a streaming platform?

This is a very good starting point because it makes comparable the rough material standards of musicians and other professional groups in the EU, irrespective of local earnings and living costs.\nMusicians everywhere, including rich countries like Germany, Austria and Slovenia have more problems with paying their bills than the general population in their countries. The only seemingly different country is Bulgaria, but in this case, the self-reported difference is small, and generally Bulgarian musicians and other Bulgarian people have similarly frequent difficulties with paying their bills.\nWorking in an emerging economy is more stressful than in a mature economy – making ends is more difficult, risks are greater and usually rules change faster. No wonder that people generally report higher level of life satisfaction in countries where the living standards are also higher: average life satisfaction in a country is greatly influenced by national income and general health level, measured by life expectancy. However, it is also recorded since the 1970s that after reaching a certain level of living standards, life satisfaction does not increase further with economic conditions. Other factors, such as vocation, work-life balance and political factors play a role, too. Working in an emerging economy is more stressful than in a mature economy – making ends is more difficult, risks are greater and usually rules change faster.\nIn the emerging music business countries, it is very important to see that the musicians not only earn little money, but as freelancers their income is mainly based on live performances, peaking in the festival season and in December. This income is usually taxed at far higher rates in the CEE region than in Western Europe or in non-creative industries. Royalties, which should balance variable live performance earnings are far lower both as a percentage of total musician income and in euro terms than in advanced markets. This is often coupled with higher taxation, too.\nTo avoid the bias of higher satisfaction levels in richer environments, we measure musician’s self-reported life satisfaction levels against the national averages from the 2018\u0026frasl;11 Eurobarometer sample, scaled between the numerical values of -2 (not at all satisfied) to 2 (very satisfied).\n\rComparing the life satisfaction levels of musicians with the general public, 2018-2019.\r\r Our comparison shows that in most of our surveyed countries, musicians are more satisfied with their lives than the average person, despite having more material difficulties. Of course, age, and other factors can contribute to this, but a vocational calling is certainly an important aspect, too. The exceptions are, interestingly, Austria and Slovenia, where the general population has a very high level of life satisfaction, and where both musicians and the general public are generally more satisfied with their lives than in the other countries. In these cases, compared to the general population, music professional are less satisfied with their lives. In Serbia our sample is too small to draw real conclusions.\n\rComparing the difficulties of paying bills among musicians and the general public, 2018-2019.\r\r Career in music can lead to higher life satisfaction than other similarly paid jobs in Europe. However, music market stakeholders should focus on increasing the level of music professional earnings and reducing its variance within the year and over the years, because the material living conditions of musicians is significantly worse than the conditions of the general population.\nYou can read a lot more about this research here.\n","date":1563724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563731100,"objectID":"245e1985699ef13b79f919fa1e741a2c","permalink":"/post/life_sat_19/","publishdate":"2019-07-21T18:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/life_sat_19/","section":"post","summary":"Career in music can lead to higher life satisfaction than other similarly paid jobs in Europe.

According to our research, the value of private copying is far bigger these days than when most CEE private copying remuneration mechanisms were set up.\nWhile the new DSM Directive is not addressing these issues, it is aiming to re-arrange the power balance between users and rightsholders of certain unlicensed, or not fully-licensed and compensated uses. We see common threats and common opportunities with the national implementations of the European legislation. Especially in the CEE region, many harware manufacturers who enjoy the benefits of the earlier regime will lobby their governments to dampen the affects of the directive. Worse still, as it will re-open the national copyright legislation in all EU countries, there will be renewed pressure from hardware manufacturers, telecom companies and Pirate Parties to minimalize the private copying remuneration. Google/YouTube/Alphabet is likely to place previously unseen, coordinated pressure on each country to minimize the value transfer compensation and at the same time minimize or abolish private copying remuneration - in all EU capitals from Sofia to Paris, from Den Haag to Prague.\n\r However, in many countries, no serious PCR regimes were created after the EU accession. In these countries, according to our calculations, only 10-30% or even less of the equitable remuneration is collected due to legal constraints.\nIf the changes initiated by the DSM Directive will be watered down, and equitable private copying remuneration will not be helped by new legislation, the music industries of these countries will conserve their huge gap compared to mature EU markets for further decades. If they follow the lead of those countries that made significant progres in this field, they can make a big step to close that gap. This will require fact-based, rational, effective adovacy material that can convince the general public, the media, legislators, and when necessary, judges about the position of the music industry.\n","date":1563289200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563289200,"objectID":"bb407eac530eab394b76ca3b790ff456","permalink":"/post/dsm_pcr_19/","publishdate":"2019-07-16T17:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/dsm_pcr_19/","section":"post","summary":"We see common threats and common opportunities with the national implementations of the DSM Directive.

In recorded music, the author, the performer and the producer are eligible for copyright and neighboring right royalties. In live music, the author and the performer are eligible for revenues, and they may or may not have a different nationality, and the concert promoter and booking manager may earn profits in another country.\nFinding out the domestic country for the author, the performer and the producer may be a very difficult task. While language is very important in most genres of popular music and in world music, language affiliation is usually a help only in small nation repertoires. But the language of a song is so important that it may be the target variable of cultural policy tools such as radio or audiovisual quotas. In classical and world music, the author may not be known or eligible for royalties anymore. In popular music and some jazz, the author and performer are usually the same artists. Nevertheless, the complexity remains. In contemporary classical music, jazz and some genres of popular music, language is not an issue because the music is instrumental, or the human voice has no real natural language connection.\nMusic Export \u0026amp; Music Import In our view, music export and music import cannot be separated from each other. Every single European market is a net importer of recorded music, given that there are no music markets where the domestic music market share exceeds 50%. In live music, domestic music traditionally is market leader in all markets, but the concentration of ticket revenues in large arena concerts and the growth of festivals is threatening the positions of domestic live music. The competition among songs, label and national repertoires is increasing very significantly with the rise of global streaming.\nIn the recorded markets, radio and audiovisual quotas and an activist role of public broadcasters could maintain a 15-30 percent market share for local artists even in smaller markets. The rise of music streaming and SVOD streaming in audiovisual works makes many of these gatekeepers irrelevant unless they find their audience and role in the new streaming channels.\nIn the live performances, some countries, especially Hungary, Serbia, Croatia and Poland found ways to create very significant export revenues for programming large festivals aimed at Western European audiences. While these solutions create vital export revenues for the music ecosystem, i.e. for promoters and technicians, it creates less opportunity for local artists. There is a growing pressure on domestic bands to extend their tour network abroad, given that the depth of domestic tour network is shrinking due to global and EU-wide small venue problem.\nArtificial intelligence and algorithms In the 21st century the total global repertoire of the last 60 years is in simultaneous competition with each other. Close to 100 million sound recordings are available in most markets. In this global competition, most music is sold by AI algorithms.\nHow CEEMID intelligence can help?  Teach new algorithms that help defending the declining domestic markets, and recommend vibrant, new local music to local audiences, and connect them on live performances, too;\n Extend market insight and tour scheduling for the whole European market, with cost, audience demography, audience taste, revenue forecast intelligence;\n Design quota schemes and public broadcaster strategies that maintain the public mandate in the 21st century;\n Design music grants that give the correct incentives to the right people. Help both foreign market reach and domestic market cultivation with correct ex ante and ex post evaluations;\n Given the complexity of the concept of ‘music export’ in the context of cultural affiliation, language, artist residence, potential separation of composer, performer and producer, music export and import is a difficult topic that requires professional, fact-driven advocacy.\n  ","date":1563282000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1563282000,"objectID":"68c2af34f5eb76effc662fbf083d3593","permalink":"/usecase/music_export/","publishdate":"2019-07-16T15:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/usecase/music_export/","section":"usecase","summary":"Music export is complicated to define, because music has a live and recorded element.

Most musicians do not only fulfill the artistic role of a performer, composer, lyricist or composer. In most cases, artists perform two artistic roles, but it is equally frequent that they perform a different, but still music related engineering, educator or managerial role. Given that that average size of creative enterprises in Europe is less than two people, musicians are forced to do several very different things. In the 20th century, larger companies, especially record labels had the necessary marketing, management, engineering staff to take care of this issues, but in the 21st century most musicians need to master all of these skills to a certain extent – at least to the extent that they can hire other, mainly freelance music professionals to help them out.\nThe reason why official labor statistics and economic statistics do not capture the performance of the music business well is that the classification of economic statistics dates to the 1960s. Two key elements of a popular musician’s work, live performances and sound recordings are in different economic classes. Composer-performers, the typical musicians of popular music do not fit into this categorization. Adding to this complexity the frequent presence of other artistic, technical, managerial or educational functions makes a musician’s work hard to categorize.\nThe complexity of musician’s work makes professional training very challenging, too. Popular music throughout the world is mainly learned in informal settings. However, this is not the ideal setting to learn the necessary managerial, economic, legal and other skills that are necessary to fulfil the freelance job of a professional musician.\nThe Three Income Stream Model of the Music Industry The three income streams model is essentially a value chain based model that was developed in the United States and adopted by the European Commission’s Joint Research Center for European CCI policy purposes. We made minor adaptations in the three income model for applicability in less developed markets in Central and Eastern Europe.\nWhile in the original American model sound recordings are the “main” income stream, currently, especially in Central Europe the live performance stream earns the most income for a typical musician. The author’s stream is the oldest, traditionally and analytically first part of the music industry that includes revenue streams based on musical works exploited by music publishers and via author’s CMO societies such as SOZA. In the US it is called the publishing stream, but in Central Europe it is dominated by authors’ societies, so we modified the label.\n","date":1559912400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559998800,"objectID":"d7f285432313741bce04589c620b905b","permalink":"/post/ceemid_19/","publishdate":"2019-06-07T15:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/ceemid_19/","section":"post","summary":"Since most music professional work in microenterprises, or as freelancers, they usually do not participate in economic statistical surveys, and their problems remain hidden from government officials and the general public.

While I do not believe that economic impact assessment for large grants or policy evaluation can be fully automated, the most painful part of the process, the gathering of correctly structured data and the most difficult calculations can be automated.\n Creation of the economic impact analysis of the Hungarian film production and extending the Hungarian tax shelter in cooperation with OrienTax.\n Economic impact assessment of the Slovak music industry within the Slovak Music Industry Report\n Ex ante grant assessement for Hungary\u0026rsquo;s Hangfoglaló program\n  ","date":1556991360,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556991360,"objectID":"5eb6d0419537143ea7fd438b33cdf6d3","permalink":"/usecase/impact/","publishdate":"2019-05-04T19:36:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/usecase/impact/","section":"usecase","summary":"Economic impact assessments, such as multiplier calculations, direct, indirect and induced employment-, tax-, value added effects calculations are very often needed for larger grants, or the design of grant calls; illegal state aid must be avoided, for example, when designing film tax shelters; or considering various policy options.\nSuch calculations require in the background very large amount of highly structure statistical data, which is very difficult to obtain and work with for non-specialist.","tags":null,"title":"Economic Impact Assessment of Music Industry","type":"docs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Private Copying Remuneration\nPCR PCR PCR\n","date":1556920800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556920800,"objectID":"b97ff6771fe69c1fb7d533192f256e1c","permalink":"/usecase/pcr/","publishdate":"2019-05-04T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/usecase/pcr/","section":"usecase","summary":"Private Copying Remuneration\nPCR PCR PCR","tags":null,"title":"Private Copying Remuneration","type":"docs"},{"authors":["Daniel Antal, CFA"],"categories":null,"content":"The venue is V klub, Národné Osvetové Centrum.\n","date":1553601600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553601600,"objectID":"b05c630566a70244911ac0d3b00a38a4","permalink":"/talk/slovak_report19/","publishdate":"2019-03-26T13:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/slovak_report19/","section":"talk","summary":"The venue is V klub, Národné Osvetové Centrum.","tags":[],"title":"Presentation of the Slovak Music Industry Report 2019","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Daniel Antal"],"categories":null,"content":"The whole report can be downloaded for free from the homepage of SOZA.\nPress reports in Slovak:\nSME: SOZA predstavila prvú Správu o slovenskom hudobnom priemysle\nKreatívna Europa: Historicky prvá Správa o slovenskom hudobnom priemysle prináša okrem analýz aj odporúčania pre budúcnosť\nIn Hungarian: Új Szó: Tudományosan a hazai zeneiparról\nSlides:\n  Spáva o hudobnom priemysle na Slovensku  from Dániel Antal \n","date":1553554800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553554800,"objectID":"b668d9c63194c3740c459000fe443b34","permalink":"/publication/slovak_music_industry_2019/","publishdate":"2019-03-26T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/slovak_music_industry_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Slovakia's first music industry report.

The adoption of European single market and copyright rules, and the increased activity of competition authority and regulators required a more structured approach to set collective royalty and compensations tariffs in the region.\nIn 2014 three societies, Artisjus, HDS and SOZA realized that need to make further efforts to modernize the way they measure their own economic impact, the economic value of their licenses to remain competitive in advocating the interests vis-\u0026#224;-vis domestic governments, international organizations like CISAC and GESAC and the European Union. They signed a Memorandum of Understanding with their consultant to set up the CEEMID databases and to harmonize their efforts.\nCEEMID by designed aimed to follow the best European practices on statistical harmonization and was already featured as an innovative best practice in the 40th anniversary of Pan European Surveying seminar in 2015. As an initiative born out of necessity, it aimed fill in the gaps of underdeveloped official cultural statics by following the guidelines of Eurostat\u0026rsquo;s ESSNet.\nFrom the originally envisioned, centralized, permission-based data structure, due to practical considerations, CEEMID switched to a more flexible, decentralized approach. This approach is based on continuous data integration, which requires permissions to use business confidential information only in use. This allowed a rapid extension of CEEMID to the whole of Europe and go even beyond. As a result of continous data integration it already includes hundreds of indicators foreseen in all pillars of the planned European Music Observatory.\nCEEMID works together with music granting agencies, music export offices and collective management societies to reach a representative segment of all professional, semi-professional and amateur artists in the countries covered: Hungary, Slovakia and Croatia, which will be extended this year to the Czech Republic and Serbia.\nData sources  Nationally representative CAP surveys of music users and film viewers.\n Anonymous CEEMID Music Professional Surveys and CEEMID Audiovisual Professional Surveys about their work, incomes and costs. See example blog post.\n Big data sources from various geolocational applications about events and location visits small video.\n Automatic data retrieval from open data sources, including statistical data and EU-funded research. See example blog post\n  Continous data integration While CEEMID is aware of and uses the metadata of CISAC\u0026rsquo;s, IFPI\u0026rsquo;s, EAO\u0026rsquo;s, and other industry sources\u0026rsquo; data, it does not contain this data, only when a user with permission for the use of these industry sources requires the integration of such data with other CEEMID data, or user-specific data. While this approach makes sharing results more cumbersome, it provided a path to increase the number of useful indicators from a few dozens to around a thousand. Furthermore, it exponentially increases the value of CISAC\u0026rsquo;s, IFPI\u0026rsquo;s or EAO\u0026rsquo;s data, especially when designing better royalty rates, or creating economic evidence for litigation. Take a look at a simple, non-confidential example blog post.\nThe CEEMID Music Professional Surveys are anonymous surveys about the live music and recording markets and granting schemes. The surveys have been filled out by about 4000 musicians, technicians, managers (and 2000 filmmakers) about the tour destinations, concert budgets and average audiences, various royalty receipts from streaming services, physical and digital sales, YouTube, Bandcamp. We are also creating comparable statistics with all EU national statistics on life satisfaction, economic expectations, income and economic situation and other characteristics of music and filmmaker professionals.\nCEEMID makes sure that the Client\u0026rsquo;s data (collective management organizations, music distributors, music export offices, music granting agencies) are correctly integrated with our survey data, statistical and big data sources, with industry data and the Client\u0026rsquo;s own transactional financial, licensing, granting or processed data. We are handling professionally data errors, missing data, currency translations and other problem areas.\nUse Cases In combination with collective management data and industry data the music professional surveys can help establish the value of certain rights, or estimate the compensation needed for home copying or the value transfer to platforms like YouTube.\nIn combination with granting data, it can be used for both ex ante evaluation to design better aimed, more cost-efficient and helpful grant calls, or to ex post evaluate the efficiency of grants and the (perceived) honesty and professionalism of the granting process.\nIn combination with the anonymized State51 test data set, it can support machine learning and deep learning (AI) algorithms to establish the potential foreign markets of certain songs, artists or national repertoires, or asses the value of recordings to optimize promotion.\n","date":1551222000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1551222000,"objectID":"f9ecb6b3cbc70328e0e3434240c3c0d5","permalink":"/project/ceemid/","publishdate":"2019-02-27T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/project/ceemid/","section":"project","summary":"CEEMID","tags":["ceemid","surveys"],"title":"CEEMID","type":"project"},{"authors":["Daniel Antal"],"categories":null,"content":"\nThis package was related to several of my works for Slovak, Hungarian and Croatian music industry and the Hungarian Film Fund, and my collaboration with Eeconomic impacT s.r.o in the Czech Republic.

In popular music performers usually play their own composition and sing their own lyrics. If the musician is self-published, all the three royalties directly pay the artist’s work. If a professional publisher is helping the artist as a composer, or a record producer as a recorded performer, they usually share the respective royalty revenues. In emerging markets fewer, in mature markets more composers are represented by publishers and performers by record labels.\nInternational Comparisons The CEEMID international comparison models are based on the implicit econometric model set out in the AKKA/LAA vs Konkurences padome case which goes far beyond the regional comparison suggested by the earlier Czech Léčebné lázně Mariánské Lázně v OSA case for comparing royalty tariffs in the European Union.\nThe EUCJ declared that “it is appropriate to compare its rates with those applicable in neighbouring Member States as well as with those applicable in other Member States adjusted in accordance with the PPP index, provided that the reference Member States have been selected in accordance with objective, appropriate and verifiable criteria and that the comparisons are made on a consistent basis.”\nIn our view, setting a royalty tariff, especially when comparison of other market prices is taken into consideration, should follow the principles of the IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement international accounting standard. This accounting standard was endorsed as an official interpretation of accounting principles by the EU Commission Regulation Regulation 2012\u0026frasl;125, which is in turn a binding interpretation in the light of the directly applicable 1126\u0026frasl;2008 EC Regulation. This document gives a practical guidance on how to use objective data in valuations. Although the language of the standard is mainly aimed at large corporation with heterogenous balance sheets, as a canonical, cross-country reading of sound accounting principles it is applicable for establishing the fair value of an assets or liabilities, including intangible assets such as royalty-earning copyright and neighboring rights.\nOn the top level of the hierarchy we find publicly observable prices in frequently traded assets, which is not applicable in our case. The second level of the hierarchy contains more reliable, publicly verifiable data sources and the third level of the hierarchy non-public information that is objective. Whenever possible, publicly available and verified information should be used.\nThe structure of the music and audiovisual industries makes the use of Level 1 input data almost impossible in a European context, because the vast majority of the industry players are microenterprises and sole solicitors, and even larger entities such as collective management societies and TV stations usually fall in the scope of the EU small- and medium size enterprise category. With few exceptions, this is the case with HORECA tariff payers, i.e. restaurants, pensions, hotels and other similar establishments. Micro-, small and medium sized enterprises are usually subject to simplified and limited financial reporting, tax reporting rules and mandatory official statistical reporting rules. Most of the EU economic statistics are created from tax and financial reports, and in other cases from mandatory statistical reports. Because creative and cultural enterprises usually do not fall into the threshold set for most enterprise statistics data collection, and because of the simplified tax and accounting reports, less official statistics can be created.\nIn the absence of high-level valuation input data, we must use level 2 (public) and level 3 (private) data sources that are by nature subject to interpretation. Such interpretation is subjective in the language of the standard because it is personally made by an objective analyst. The reliability of the valuation depends not only on the quality of the data, which is the case with level 1 data, but on the sound analysis of a competent analyst.\nCEEMID made a large effort in the last 5 years to use high quality, publicly observable data and private data to create meaningful and objective social, economic and cultural indicators as set out in the EUCJ preliminary decision.\nMarket Comparators The best models are based on market data and use information on prices and quantities agreed by independent, arms-length contractual partners. Our market comparator models process all collectively managed and estimated individually licensed uses of music and audiovisual content in a country. It is than possible to compare private copying values, value transfer to media platforms, or individual uses such as radio or television to the total market value of music listening per hour or film watching per hour. These models require the most data input.\nWe used such estimates in the Slovak Music Industry Report, in the calculation of private copying benefits to consumers and value transfer to YouTube in Hungary and Croatia.\nDirect Estimates \u0026amp; Hypothetical Evaluations Direct estimates are measuring quantities of unknown uses and they relate them to known market prices. Hypothetical evaluations ask the willingness of users to pay for uses. These models are easier to create, require less information, but they can be more easily challenged by regulators, licensees or auditors, because they do not rely only on independent and arms-length transaction data.\nHedonic Pricing Hedonic price models are econometric price models that establish the residua value of music in complex services like hoteling or restaurant services. We have used hedonic price modelling to establish the value of music use in the HORECA sector. Technically these models could be used to evaluate the use in television or radio but the data requirements are extensive.\n","date":1546470000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1558099980,"objectID":"12972acfcd81049e068ee2b4d261795f","permalink":"/usecase/royalty_setting/","publishdate":"2019-01-03T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/usecase/royalty_setting/","section":"usecase","summary":"The copyright and neighboring right royalty is the wage-like earning of the music performer, the composer and producer.

However, defying some economic expectation, to growth is stronger in mature markets than in most emerging markets, and most of the global growth came from the United States. The dollar-based IFPI Global Music Report hides the fact that mature and emerging Europe is truly lagging behind the United States.\nThe European music scene is very fragmented, has many languages and the lack of critical market size often leads to neglect by innovative global players. In a world where most music is soled by big data driven algorithms in subscription streams, the lack of large repertoires, data analytics capabilities and critical audience masses puts the smaller European repertoires into a competitive disadvantage.\n\r\r We had a very interesting discussion that will lead to hopefully many new initiatives on a number of problems, including low market prices in collectively managed and private channels, distribution problems, the difficulties and opportunities in regional cooperation and a number of other topics. The presentation and the working paper is not public, but the similar workshops in the future may help growing a more mature network of CEE industry players and the adoption of new business models, pricing and promotion methods and more coordinated planning and marketing.\n","date":1509523200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1509559200,"objectID":"1c60a079480d2fe9ad833bc5e4a7b4bd","permalink":"/post/cee_mini_17/","publishdate":"2017-11-01T09:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/cee_mini_17/","section":"post","summary":"I presented my market view and experience with distinguished colleagues from the Baltic states, Central Europe and the Balkan, representatives of WIN and IFPI and the international indie distributor State 51.

Spotify pays out about 20% of its royalties to publishers. Because the labels are the bigger stakeholders, they often do not provide the necessary information for work identification in the case of publishers.\nDominic from Netflix is already one of the biggest buyers of music, and I believe that his company’s footprint will just continue growing.

They mainly use original film music, and to a significant degree, catalogs.\nBen made a presentation about their innovation efforts at ICE digital rights management. Working with some of the largest repertoires represented by PRS, GEMA and STIM, they really offer world class services.

There are many reasons for this, all a bit touched upon the other speaker’s issues, and their implementation difficulties n the CEE region, especially different revenue stream breakup, strong collective management and relatively underdeveloped publishing. The region is about 200% or more below its benchmark in the sales we were talking about in this session.

After several years on the stage musician’s got a recording contract, and usually even later they registered their first composition. The recording stream was the most important revenue source. The making of a record was expensive and offered considerable royalties or advances.\nIn the 21st century the live music stream is far more important than the recordings. Creating recordings is much cheaper and stage performances are expensive. Musicians usually create their music, also register it as a music work and offer it to the public on an online portfolio of mp3 downloads, YouTube and music streams. Often they are booked for their first live performance after publishing a recording.\nWhat does it mean for the musician and the manager? First and foremost that traditional career development strategies do not work anymore. A convincing stage performance is mandatory with a good touring strategy. Recordings are often not profitable, but equally important in building the audience.

Our mandate was to create concrete granting proposals that have a high chance of making a change in terms of the later royalty earning capabilities of artists.\nIn the first phase of the project, we made two workshops with the eight fields development method to understand the challenges and existing working practices that result in a low level of royalties paid out in Hungary. This methodology requires a groupwork of all stakeholders and professionals of the industry. In this case, we worked in groups of 30-40, covering various artists, stage, light, sound technicians, producers, managers and even band transporters. One group predominantly was Budapest-based and one in Eastern Hungary, to have a different view on working and market conditions in the metropolitan city and in the countryside. While royalties are not applicable for live music, it was well understood by the granting authority and the music industry that royalties cannot grow without a healthy live music sector in the country.\nIn the workshop, the consultant with several aides facilitates a very structured conversation that starts with a desired state of the industry which is not described by slogans but by actual characterizations of a desired working environment. Instead of envisioning that “everybody gets a grant”, we describe the ideal project planning and management cycle of a new tour or record to see how a granting can fit into this workflow and what type of grants add effective assistance to realize goals. For each goal and change we envision how that effects the work of the performing artists, her manager, the technician crew, even the schedule of the tour bus driver. We discuss if the change makes any material change in the way we can prepare for a new album release.\nIn the latter stages what sort of changes we envision in day practices, programmers, institutions and what concrete steps are needed to be made to get there. As a controlling step, we assign indicators that can be objectively judged, and which can show the degree of change if recommended actions are taken.\nThe advantage of the eight-fields methodology, which was originally developed to support EU and global aid program design is that it allows conflicting viewpoints, finding consensus, and display very highly detailed policy and program scenarios already in a day. It is generally a very enjoyable experience for artists and professionals. If the workshop takes place over 2 days, a first draft program is already presented on the second morning and by the end of the day participants usually have a detailed program. In this case, we came up with dozens of concrete proposals, many of which could be addressed to the stakeholders themselves without any action taken from the granting authority.\n\r\r\r\r In the next stage we carried out the annual CEEMID Music Professional Survey with additional questions where artists, managers and technicians could rate the proposals. They could also optionally give their next year development priorities in the fields of live performances, recordings and composition, in the context of their current work, pre-existing financing and professional assistance of financial assistance needs. In Hungary, more than 1000 music professionals filled out the survey in 2015.\nAt the end of the workshop and the survey, we could present a very comprehensive policy and granting program, with preliminary estimates on granting needs, ideal and minimum grant sizes, and grant contractual conditions to avoid grant calls that cannot be contracted out to winners due to unrealistic prerequisites.\nThese results, with suggested cultural policy indicators, program indicators and budgetary outlines were presented to the granting authority of the Cseh Tamás Program (currently named: Hangfoglaló Popular Music Support Program)\n","date":1447351200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1447351200,"objectID":"a4769dcbb572f35c186d0052bd7d38b0","permalink":"/post/cstp_15/","publishdate":"2015-11-12T19:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/cstp_15/","section":"post","summary":"The data and intelligence of CEEMID was used in Hungary to create an ex ante evaluation of the new Cseh Tamás Program to support popular music development in Hungary.

CVM surveys result in well-behaved demand curves for music in public places. Tariffs can be directly validated. Choice modeling reveals that consumers demand music and are rather insensitive to its price. Tariff levels are generally approved. Hedonic pricing reveals the different value added by different restaurants, bars, etc. – crucial for good value proposition and risk sharing with differentiated tariffs.

This weakens Hungary’s national competitiveness while simultaneously lowering consumer spending on non-energy categories.
