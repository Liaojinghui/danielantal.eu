Musicians earn their income after their recorded performances when it is played in a public performance or when it is mechanically copied. Like wages and services in a market economy, the remuneration for the use of their work should reflect some sort of market value. In the case of copyrighted music, this market value is a part of the added value in a service.\n##CEEMID The following steps apply to collective rights management, which is most of rights management in the Central, Eastern and Southern European markets. In individual rights managements, some of these techniques can be useful, but further methods can be used, because they are usually not limited to the same extent by competition law restrictions.\nCEEMID, the Central Eastern European Music Industry Database was set up after a memorandum was signed by several collective management entities and my former consulting company. Its main objective was to collect and organize data in a way that allows to calculate the economic value added of music and other relevant data for setting the price of music. CEEMID contains hundreds of indicators about music consumption, price, and related economic, sociocultural and consumption data.\nAppropirate benchmarks The jurisprudence of the Court of the European Union has touched upon music collective royalties with increasing frequency in the last decade. I believe that currently the most applicable case law is Autortiesību un komunicēšanās konsultāciju aģentūra/Latvijas Autoru apvienība v Konkurences padome, or shortly, AKKA/LAA vs Konkurences padome. A notable precursor to this decision the one made in the Czech case between the Czech collective management organization OSA and hotels, OSA v Léčebné lázně Mariánské Lázně.\nAccording the Court decision, significant differences between royalty prices on the European Single Market must be based on objective differences of economic, sociocultural factors and consumption habits. In the past 5 years, CEEMID has collected hundreds of economic, sociocultural consumption indicators to understand the differences of European markets in live music, recorded music, and in the important connecting markets of films, software games, restaurants, hotels, tv, radio and other big users of music.\nInternational comparison \u0026hellip;\nAdding original valuation An important problem with international comparison is that it will create a deadly vortex to the bottom if it is not applied in all territories, and no independent valuations are made. The international comparison is a benchmarking exercise at most, but it gives no direct valuation of music royalties. It is a very useful start, but it should be combined with true valuation.\nThe value of music, when used by business entities, such as radio stations, restaurants, or software game producers is based on the value in use, or the value added by combining music with some other service or product. A study commissioned by IFPI, the international record industry body, has enumerated several methods to value music in a study created by PWC.\n Analysing ‘comparable’ market outcomes is a very powerful tool, because it uses information that is most trusted by auditors and courts: market prices. The CEEMID full market model, powered by CEEMID indicators and nationally representative special consumer surveys, is very advanced application of the comparable market outcomes model, and it can be used to measure the value gap, set the value of private copying, or price collectively managed or individually managed royalties.\n Analysing the value music adds to businesses has an economic and a financial model. The financial model is not very useful in Central and Eastern Europe because of the lack of information, but the hedonic pricing economic model is a very powerful tool. We used it with CEE clients for setting restaurant and hotel tariffs.\n Analysing the behaviour and preferences of consumers leads to various experimental models, such as test screenings / hearings. They are widely used in the radio, film, television industry, and generally they are a very good tool for individual royalties. However, we also used them successfully to establish royalty tariffs for restaurants and department stores.\n  Which model to choose? In my experience, the best is to use as many as possible, because data limitations, and limitations of competition authorities or regulators to understand the models may not be foreseen. A good international comparison following the guidelines of the CJEU and at least two independent valuations usually wins the argument.\nAdding original valuation Documentation and data maintenance ","date":1546470000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546470000,"objectID":"12972acfcd81049e068ee2b4d261795f","permalink":"/usecase/royalty_setting/","publishdate":"2019-01-03T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/usecase/royalty_setting/","section":"usecase","summary":"The copyright royalty is the wage of the music performer, composer and producer.

Even though Croatia appears to be more similar to the UK than the region, a deeper analysis of the data reveals that this is not the case. The most important difference between mature markets and emerging markets is the lack of good distribution and monetization strategy for recorded music.\nCollecting and analyzing industry data is very important for small, national music industries that do not have a large enough repertoire that can be easily promoted on global platforms such as Spotify, Deezer or YouTube. New digital platforms produce relatively low income for Central and Southeastern European artists and labels, but they are growing at a rate similar to mature markets with a short, 1-5 years lag.

CVM surveys result in well-behaved demand curves for music in public places. Tariffs can be directly validated. Choice modeling reveals that consumers demand music and are rather insensitive to its price. Tariff levels are generally approved. Hedonic pricing reveals the different value added by different restaurants, bars, etc. – crucial for good value proposition and risk sharing with differentiated tariffs. Source: Various surveys designed by Visegrad Investments, conducted by Gfk Hungary, Universitas and Artisjus territorial representatives.\n Econometric analysis differentiates high- and low-willing-to-pay customers Improving existing tariff differentiation can lead to a win-win situation. The same amount of royalty can be collected with less pain and less risk of loosing royalty payers, or even increase the number of customers who can experience high-quality 9 Economic analysis helps to create better tariff differentiation that is more accepted by payers without changing the average level of royalties, leading to less loss to royalty-free or cheap repertoire alternatives. Willingness-to-pay survey based on new hypothetical offerings reveal that better differentiated tariffs can significantly improve value proposition.\n Public performance: changes in the restaurant, entertainment, retail outlet industry makes periodical tariff review necessary. The structure of restaurant, leisure and retailing changed significantly over two decades, creating chains of restaurants or retail outlets that have significant bargaining power and professional purchasing management.\n  There is a lot more information on the slides.\nRead more in the Use cases of this website.\n","date":1384729200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1384729200,"objectID":"3c51e1947f786cb2759f96d0ceba4f22","permalink":"/post/cisac_goodg_13/","publishdate":"2013-11-18T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/post/cisac_goodg_13/","section":"post","summary":"My short presentation highlighted the fact that the CEE region’s is much richer in terms of household cultural and recreational spending than music publishers believe.","tags":["cisac","pricing","private-copying","pcr","restaurants","hedonic-pricing","valuation"],"title":"Value added by music in public performance and home copying: economic theory and empirical applications for tariff setting","type":"post"},{"authors":["Daniel Antal"],"categories":null,"content":"More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1372629600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372629600,"objectID":"38c215a6f98e9e0f06de89991d8e504f","permalink":"/publication/amchan_energy_2010/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/amchan_energy_2010/","section":"publication","summary":"It is AmCham’s view that Hungary does not have a consistent energy policy evaluation framework that would enable policymakers and investors to correctly establish priorities and create a roadmap towards energy security. In the current situation, Hungarians on average, both consumer and industrial, pay relatively more for their energy while using it less efficiently than their Western European counterparts. This weakens Hungary’s national competitiveness while simultaneously lowering consumer spending on non-energy categories. By reviewing leading manufacturing-oriented, energy-dependent countries, it shows that Hungary’s problems are not a given. Germany uses less than half the amount of energy Hungary uses to create a single euro of GDP. Japan has an excellent evaluation, planning and policy mix that resulted in exemplary energy savings in the past three decades. The Hungarian government can take a number of actions in the domestic economy to improve this situation, as well as initiate better co-operation regionally.","tags":["investments","environment","energy","regulation","Hungary"],"title":"AmCham Energy and Environment Committee published Position Brief","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Daniel Antal"],"categories":null,"content":"The original title in Hungarian is Az üreshordozó díjrendszer vizsgálata.\n","date":1372629600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1372629600,"objectID":"8152c355fba581beeeaae19a799a55c5","permalink":"/publication/pcr_hungary_2013/","publishdate":"2013-07-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/publication/pcr_hungary_2013/","section":"publication","summary":"An economic analysis of the evolution of private copying, its benefits for the Hungarian households and the equitable remuneration for music and film copyright and neighboring right owners.
