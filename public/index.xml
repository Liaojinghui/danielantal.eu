      <description>&lt;p&gt;If we take a look at the streaming charts of the region, we usually find that the vast majority of the streamed songs are foreign songs - except for Austria, U.S. songs.  For comparison, we added a similar, middle-income emerging market (Argentina) and a rich, small-population English-speaking country, Australia to the chart. These countries seem to be in a similar position to the CEE countries.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/a&gt;
  

  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arguably, the strongest countries of songwriting are the United States and Brazil - these are the countries that have ran out of the ISRC recording identifier range. Their charts are full with their domestic songs, but they are not alone.  Japan, France, and the bigger EU countries, France, Germany and Poland have very strong domestic performance, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are many factor at play here. Large countries with large artist populations generate a lot more recordings, so they local fans always have thousands of new songs to select from.  In small countries, the total annual creations, from pop to jazz, from authentic folk to classical amounts to a few thousand tracks. But it is not only size that matters.  Sweden&amp;rsquo;s population is similar to that of Austria, Hungary and Czechia, yet the Swedish repertoire performs better in Sweden, and as we will see in the next chart, abroad, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We created a second chart to visualize how hits are travelling accross the borders. To make the chart easier to read, we omitted the United States, Brazil and Japan as countries of origin, and concentrated only on intra-European hit flows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second week of September 2019 was not an exceptional week. Most EU countries&amp;rsquo; producers did not score any hits in any other EU countries&amp;rsquo; Spotify Top 50 hits.  The UK exported many great hits to all over Europe, as usual, but there were other important hit flows. These hits mainly follow cultural proximity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;France exported hits to the two Francophone countries of Europe, Belgium and Romania, and furthermore to Greece, a Southern country with particularly unique chart composition. Germany exported many hits to Austria, another German-speaking country, and some hits to other Germanic countries. Dutch producers placed a few hits in the Germanic countries and in Belgium, where the Dutch-speaking Flemish community has its own radios, TVs, press and hitlists. The Netherlands is a powerhouse of electronic popmusic that are not bound by language which finds auidence in several countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;load ( file.path(&#39;plots&#39;, &#39;eu_charts_eu_share_plot_2019-09-15.rda&#39;)  )

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The strength and competitive position of the national market where an artists is most known and has a fan base is usually a determining factor of track performance and revenue.  The overall revenue prospects and competition situation of a Hungarian or Croatian song is very different from a British or even a Polish song.  But overall, most European recordings are not bound to a domestic country. Because of cultural proximity, the presense of native minorities or new imigrant diasporas, even small-language songs are being listened to on a much wider territory than the artists&amp;rsquo; original country. Some relatively small EU countries, such as Sweden and the Netherlands successfully export their music on a regular basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, as the streaming services slowly overtake all other forms of use, the charts above depict a very fundamental market change.  Whereas in the traditional channels of physical sales, digital downloads and broadcasting, the CEE countries, like other small- and medium-sized EU countries, enjoyed 30-50% market share, among the streaming hits their producer&amp;rsquo;s share is below 10%. It is not unusual to find only domestic recordings in physical sales hitlists, while domestic songs rarely enter the streaming charts in the region, with the exception of Poland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The traditional sales channels protected CEE markets in several ways.  After EU accession most import duties are gone, but phyisical products have very signifcant logistics costs, which gives local producers a competitive edge.  Because physical products are increasingly sold on concerts and festivals, where the market share of domestic performers is usually very high, the traditional, mechanically licensed sales had a protected market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The broadcasting channel, which used the be the most important promotion channel, too, was protected in many European countries by national content quotas, or supported with generously funded national, regional, local public broadcasters who gave a preference to national composers, producers and performers. These market barriers are not present in the streaming markets, which poses many questions. Our research is aiming to answer these questions, but it took several years to build a data infrastructure that can help producing an accurate market overview.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Panel Discussion of the Central Euroepan Music Industry Report 2019</title>
      <link>/talk/waves_2019/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The panel discussion of the first comprehensive Central and Eastern European report (Albania, Armenia, Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Estonia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia)  will be in held on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wavesvienna.com/conference/conference-schedule/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Waves Music Showcase Festival and Conference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quoted from the conference agenda:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEEMID – Central &amp;amp; Eastern European Music Databases was created out of necessity: many Central and Eastern European countries are lacking effective cross-industry or governmental statistics on music or on cultural industries in general. The lack of data makes the work of tour planning, record promotion, grant evaluation or royalty tariff setting very difficult in those countries where the need would be even greater for such activities than in the most advanced markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musicians are the most known source of information&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Antal developed a survey distributed among music professionals asking them about their experience. These surveys were designed to fill the gaps in the data collection of official statistics and other music and film industry sources. The first survey was made in 2014 in Hungary, and in 2019 it already included 11 countries. They had been filled out in the past years by more than 5000 creative industry professional, in 2019 in Austria, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Antal believes that the music business in most of Europe, including Austria, has many common, similar challenges and would need a lot more regional cooperation to solve them. With the CEEMID-report, presented at the Waves Vienna Conference. Daniel Antal gives a fact-based comparison and will suggest some possible policy and strategic solutions to be debated after.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Musicians’ Living Standards And Life Satisfaction In The CEE Region</title>
      <link>/post/life_sat_19/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 21 Jul 2019 18:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/life_sat_19/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In order to get a high-level comparison among the living standards of musicians, we use the standard survey question used in Eurobarometer surveys for decades: how often have had the respondent difficulties with paying bills in the past year?   This is a very good starting point because it makes comparable the rough material standards of musicians and other professional groups in the EU, irrespective of local earnings and living costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Musicians everywhere, including rich countries like Germany, Austria and Slovenia have more problems with paying their bills than the general population in their countries.  The only seemingly different country is Bulgaria, but in this case, the self-reported difference is small, and generally Bulgarian musicians and other Bulgarian people have similarly frequent difficulties with paying their bills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in an emerging economy is more stressful than in a mature economy – making ends is more difficult, risks are greater and usually rules change faster. No wonder that people generally report higher level of life satisfaction in countries where the living standards are also higher: average life satisfaction in a country is &lt;a href=&#34;https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;greatly influenced&lt;/a&gt; by national income and general health level, measured by life expectancy.  However, it is also recorded since the 1970s that after reaching a certain level of living standards, life satisfaction does not increase further with economic conditions. Other factors, such as vocation, work-life balance and political factors play a role, too. Working in an emerging economy is more stressful than in a mature economy – making ends is more difficult, risks are greater and usually rules change faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the emerging music business countries, it is very important to see that the musicians not only earn little money, but as freelancers their income is mainly based on live performances, peaking in the festival season and in December. This income is usually taxed at far higher rates in the CEE region than in Western Europe or in non-creative industries.  Royalties, which should balance variable live performance earnings are far lower both as a percentage of total musician income and in euro terms than in advanced markets. This is often coupled with higher taxation, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To avoid the bias of higher satisfaction levels in richer environments, we measure musician’s self-reported life satisfaction levels against the national averages from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/sdesc2.asp?no=7489&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2018&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; Eurobarometer sample&lt;/a&gt;, scaled between the numerical values of -2 (not at all satisfied) to 2 (very satisfied).&lt;/p&gt;




  

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;img src=&#34;/img/musician_charts/life_satisfaction_levels.jpg&#34; /&gt;

  &lt;h4&gt;Comparing the life satisfaction levels of musicians with the general public, 2018-2019.&lt;/h4&gt;
  
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our comparison shows that in most of our surveyed countries, musicians are more satisfied with their lives than the average person, despite having more material difficulties.  Of course, age, and other factors can contribute to this, but a vocational calling is certainly an important aspect, too.  The exceptions are, interestingly, Austria and Slovenia, where the general population has a very high level of life satisfaction, and where both musicians and the general public are generally more satisfied with their lives than in the other countries. In these cases, compared to the general population, music professional are less satisfied with their lives. In Serbia our sample is too small to draw real conclusions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Career in music can lead to higher life satisfaction than other similarly paid jobs in Europe.  However, music market stakeholders should focus on increasing the level of music professional earnings and reducing its variance within the year and over the years, because the material living conditions of musicians is significantly worse than the conditions of the general population.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>DSM Directive, Value Gap &amp; Private Copying Levies</title>
      <link>/post/dsm_pcr_19/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2019 17:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/dsm_pcr_19/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Private copying after 60 years remains a very important way of spreading recorded music, books and audiovisual works, and a very important source of revenue for artists, composers, writers, film writers and performers if managed properly.   According to our research, the value of private copying is far bigger these days than when most CEE private copying remuneration mechanisms were set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the new &lt;a href=&#34;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/dir/2019/790/oj&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;DSM Directive&lt;/a&gt; is not addressing these issues, it is aiming to re-arrange the power balance between users and rightsholders of certain unlicensed, or not fully-licensed and compensated uses. We see &lt;strong&gt;common threats and common opportunities&lt;/strong&gt; with the national implementations of the European legislation.  Especially in the CEE region, many harware manufacturers who enjoy the benefits of the earlier regime will lobby their governments to dampen the affects of the directive. Worse still, as it will re-open the national copyright legislation in all EU countries, there will be renewed pressure from hardware manufacturers, telecom companies and Pirate Parties to minimalize the private copying remuneration. Google/YouTube/Alphabet is likely to place previously unseen, coordinated pressure on each country to minimize the value transfer compensation and at the same time minimize or abolish private copying remuneration - in all EU capitals from Sofia to Paris, from Den Haag to Prague.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;gallery&#34;&gt;

  
  
  
  
    
    
    
    
    
      
    
    
  &lt;a data-fancybox=&#34;gallery-gallery&#34; href=&#34;/post/dsm_pcr_19/gallery/conversion_to_payer.png&#34; data-caption=&#34;Conversion over a decade: people start to pay online, but they are not everywhere turning for paid music and film sources.&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;/post/dsm_pcr_19/gallery/conversion_to_payer.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;/a&gt;
  

  
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, in many countries, no serious PCR regimes were created after the EU accession.  In these countries, according to our calculations, only 10-30% or even less of the equitable remuneration is collected due to legal constraints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the changes initiated by the &lt;em&gt;DSM Directive&lt;/em&gt; will be watered down, and equitable private copying remuneration will not be helped by new legislation, the music industries of these countries will conserve their huge gap compared to mature EU markets for further decades.  If they follow the lead of those countries that made significant progres in this field, they can make a big step to close that &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/post/cee_mini_17/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;gap&lt;/a&gt;.  This will require fact-based, rational, effective adovacy material that can convince the general public, the media, legislators, and when necessary, judges about the position of the music industry.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Music Export</title>
      <link>/usecase/music_export/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 16 Jul 2019 15:00:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/usecase/music_export/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Music export is complicated to define, because music has a live and recorded element.  In recorded music, the author, the performer and the producer are eligible for copyright and neighboring right royalties.  In live music, the author and the performer are eligible for revenues, and they may or may not have a different nationality, and the concert promoter and booking manager may earn profits in another country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding out the domestic country for the author, the performer and the producer may be a very difficult task. While language is very important in most genres of popular music and in world music, language affiliation is usually a help only in small nation repertoires.  But the language of a song is so important that it may be the target variable of cultural policy tools such as radio or audiovisual quotas.
In classical and world music, the author may not be known or eligible for royalties anymore.  In popular music and some jazz, the author and performer are usually the same artists.  Nevertheless, the complexity remains. In contemporary classical music, jazz and some genres of popular music, language is not an issue because the music is instrumental, or the human voice has no real natural language connection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;music-export-music-import&#34;&gt;Music Export &amp;amp; Music Import&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our view, music export and music import cannot be separated from each other.  Every single European market is a net importer of recorded music, given that there are no music markets where the domestic music market share exceeds 50%.  In live music, domestic music traditionally is market leader in all markets, but the concentration of ticket revenues in large arena concerts and the growth of festivals is threatening the positions of domestic live music.  The competition among songs, label and national repertoires is increasing very significantly with the rise of global streaming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the recorded markets, radio and audiovisual quotas and an activist role of public broadcasters could maintain a 15-30 percent market share for local artists even in smaller markets. The rise of music streaming and SVOD streaming in audiovisual works makes many of these gatekeepers irrelevant unless they find their audience and role in the new streaming channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the live performances, some countries, especially Hungary, Serbia, Croatia and Poland found ways to create very significant export revenues for programming large festivals aimed at Western European audiences.  While these solutions create vital export revenues for the music ecosystem, i.e. for promoters and technicians, it creates less opportunity for local artists.  There is a growing pressure on domestic bands to extend their tour network abroad, given that the depth of domestic tour network is shrinking due to global and EU-wide small venue problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;artificial-intelligence-and-algorithms&#34;&gt;Artificial intelligence and algorithms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 21st century the total global repertoire of the last 60 years is in simultaneous competition with each other. Close to 100 million sound recordings are available in most markets.  In this global competition, most music is sold by AI algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-ceemid-intelligence-can-help&#34;&gt;How CEEMID intelligence can help?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teach new algorithms that help defending the declining domestic markets, and recommend vibrant, new local music to local audiences, and connect them on live performances, too;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extend market insight and tour scheduling for the whole European market, with cost, audience demography, audience taste, revenue forecast intelligence;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design quota schemes and public broadcaster strategies that maintain the public mandate in the 21st century;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Design music grants that give the correct incentives to the right people.  Help both foreign market reach and domestic market cultivation with correct ex ante and ex post evaluations;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the complexity of the concept of ‘music export’ in the context of cultural affiliation, language, artist residence, potential separation of composer, performer and producer, music export and import is a difficult topic that requires professional, fact-driven advocacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>CEEMID Music Professionals Survey 2019</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;The fragmentation of the music business into microenterprises and freelance carriers make the work of a musician very complex.  Most musicians do not only fulfill the artistic role of a performer, composer, lyricist or composer.  In most cases, artists perform two artistic roles, but it is equally frequent that they perform a different, but still music related engineering, educator or managerial role.  Given that that average size of creative enterprises in Europe is less than two people, musicians are forced to do several very different things.  In the 20th century, larger companies, especially record labels had the necessary marketing, management, engineering staff to take care of this issues, but in the 21st century most musicians need to master all of these skills to a certain extent – at least to the extent that they can hire other, mainly freelance music professionals to help them out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/img/three_income_streams_croatia.png&#34; alt=&#34;Three income streams model&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason why official labor statistics and economic statistics do not capture the performance of the music business well is that the classification of economic statistics dates to the 1960s.  Two key elements of a popular musician’s work, live performances and sound recordings are in different economic classes. Composer-performers, the typical musicians of popular music do not fit into this categorization.  Adding to this complexity the frequent presence of other artistic, technical, managerial or educational functions makes a musician’s work hard to categorize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The complexity of musician’s work makes professional training very challenging, too.  Popular music throughout the world is mainly learned in informal settings.  However, this is not the ideal setting to learn the necessary managerial, economic, legal and other skills that are necessary to fulfil the freelance job of a professional musician.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-three-income-stream-model-of-the-music-industry&#34;&gt;The Three Income Stream Model of the Music Industry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three income streams model is essentially a value chain based model that was developed in the United States and adopted by the European Commission’s Joint Research Center for European CCI policy purposes. We made minor adaptations in the three income model for applicability in less developed markets in Central and Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While in the original American model sound recordings are the “main” income stream, currently, especially in Central Europe the live performance stream earns the most income for a typical musician. The author’s stream is the oldest, traditionally and analytically first part of the music industry that includes revenue streams based on musical works exploited by music publishers and via author’s CMO societies such as SOZA. In the US it is called the publishing stream, but in Central Europe it is dominated by authors’ societies, so we modified the label.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Open Data &amp; Re-use Of Public Sector Information</title>
      <link>/usecase/psi/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 May 2019 19:36:00 +0200</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/usecase/psi/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been involved since 2003 in the creation of official and non-official statistics and in the re-use of public sector information.  CEEMID from the onset took benefit from the re-use of public sector information directive which had been replaced in 2019 with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?qid=1561563110433&amp;amp;uri=CELEX:32019L1024&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;EU Open Data Directive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European governments, and the EU itself, collects information that is worth billions of euros for the commercial and non-governmental sector. While PSI is generally free, or very cheap in the EU, the re-use of these information sources usually requires deep knowledge and further investment, given that these public information sources were never designed for the secondary public or commercial need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEEMID has built hundreds of indicators from various EU public information sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are creating new music and audiovisual industry related statistics from raw data collected for other purposes, such as inflation measurement or public policy assessment in the EU using our proprietary software and some open source software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our economic impact assessment tool is, for example, builds heavily on our &lt;a href=&#34;http://iotables.ceemid.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;iotables software&lt;/a&gt; that we released as an open source software within the framework of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ropengov.github.io/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;rOpenGov&lt;/a&gt; collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;CEEMID was made out of necessity in EU member states when official statistics are missing key elements of the music or other creative industries.  We had been experimenting with big data sources since 2017, especially to find ways to break down statistics to regional or city level, and to find leading indictors or estimators where government statistics are not available, or available only with a very long time delay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/fpfis/mwikis/essnetbigdata/index.php/Main_Page&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;ESSnet Big Data&lt;/a&gt; is a project within the European statistical system (ESS) jointly undertaken by 28 partners. Its objective is the integration of big data in the regular production of official statistics, through pilots exploring the potential of selected big data sources, and through building and implementing concrete applications. We are closely monitoring such developments, and aim to integrate ESSNet Big Data recommendations into the CEEMID workflow &lt;a href=&#34;/publication/creating_better_2015/&#34;&gt;similarly to&lt;/a&gt; earlier ESSnet Culture recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;google-trends&#34;&gt;Google Trends&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google Trends creates a fully anonymous sample of Google search traffic. Because of the way Google allows the use of Google Trends and scales results, it is very complicated to use Google Trends across regions and countries.  However, our experience shows that Google Trends is an excellent short-term forecasting tool for ticket sales.  It also means that it can serve as a good estimator for ticket sales for regions and territories where few reliable data sources exist.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Economic Impact Assessment of Music Industry</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Economic impact assessments, such as multiplier calculations, direct, indirect and induced employment-, tax-, value added effects calculations are very often needed for larger grants, or the design of grant calls; illegal state aid must be avoided, for example, when designing film tax shelters; or considering various policy options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such calculations require in the background very large amount of highly structure statistical data, which is very difficult to obtain and work with for non-specialist.   Such data must be accompanied by internal financial data or user survey data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;iotables&#34;&gt;iotables&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My open source &lt;a href=&#34;http://iotables.ceemid.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;iotables&lt;/a&gt; software, released within the scope of the rOpenGov collaboration, is aimed at correctly structuring data and conducting must of the algebraic work related to these tasks. Read &lt;a href=&#34;/post/iotables_04/&#34;&gt;more about iotables&lt;/a&gt; among my blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am working together with &lt;a href=&#34;http://kulkal.cz/?lang=en&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;KulKal&lt;/a&gt; to make this online cultural calculator usable in all EU member states in the future using some of the features of iotables. Our cooperation started with using some of iotables and CEEMID data in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sharedcities.eu/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Shared Cities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;impact-assessment&#34;&gt;Impact assessment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Economic impact assessment, apart from the use of highly structured national accounts data and algebraic knowledge require organization or national association specific financial data, accounting data or user survey data.  Currently I am working on various applications to standardize these tools, so that each festival organizer, music export office, film fund and tax shelter and other similar organization can use it according to its needs.  While I do not believe that economic impact assessment for large grants or policy evaluation can be fully automated, the most painful part of the process, the gathering of correctly structured data and the most difficult calculations can be automated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Creation of the economic impact analysis of the Hungarian film production and extending the Hungarian tax shelter in cooperation with OrienTax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>CEEMID</title>
      <link>/project/ceemid/</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/tags/ceemid/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CEEMID&lt;/a&gt; (Central and Eastern European Music Industry Databases)  was created out of necessity following a CISAC Good Governance Seminar for European Societies in 2013.  The adoption of European single market and copyright rules, and the increased activity of competition authority and regulators required a more structured approach to set collective royalty and compensations tariffs in the region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014 three societies, Artisjus, HDS and SOZA realized that need to make further efforts to modernize the way they measure their own economic impact, the economic value of their licenses to remain competitive in advocating the interests vis-&amp;#224;-vis domestic governments, international organizations like CISAC and GESAC and the European Union. They signed a Memorandum of Understanding with their consultant to set up the CEEMID databases and to harmonize their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEEMID by designed aimed to follow the best European practices on statistical harmonization and was already featured as an innovative &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/publication/creating_better_2015/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;best practice&lt;/a&gt; in the 40th anniversary of Pan European Surveying seminar in 2015.  As an initiative born out of necessity, it aimed fill in the gaps of underdeveloped official cultural statics by following the guidelines of Eurostat&amp;rsquo;s ESSNet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the originally envisioned, centralized, permission-based data structure, due to practical considerations, CEEMID switched to a more flexible, decentralized approach. This approach is based on continuous data integration, which requires permissions to use business confidential information only in use. This allowed a rapid extension of CEEMID to the whole of Europe and go even beyond.  As a result of continous data integration it already includes hundreds of indicators foreseen in all pillars of the planned European Music Observatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEEMID works together with music granting agencies, music export offices and collective management societies to reach a representative segment of all professional, semi-professional and amateur artists in the countries covered: Hungary, Slovakia and Croatia, which will be extended this year to the Czech Republic and Serbia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;data-sources&#34;&gt;Data sources&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nationally representative &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/usecase/cap/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CAP surveys&lt;/a&gt; of music users and film viewers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anonymous &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/usecase/musicians/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;CEEMID Music Professional Surveys&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;CEEMID Audiovisual Professional Surveys&lt;/em&gt; about their work, incomes and costs. See example &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/post/career_path/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big data sources from various geolocational applications about events and location visits &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lW8bhQ2fbY&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;small video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automatic data retrieval from open data sources, including statistical data and EU-funded research. See example &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/post/how_many_ever_pay/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;continous-data-integration&#34;&gt;Continous data integration&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While CEEMID is aware of and uses the metadata of CISAC&amp;rsquo;s, IFPI&amp;rsquo;s, EAO&amp;rsquo;s, and other industry sources&amp;rsquo; data, it does not contain this data, only when a user with permission for the use of these industry sources requires the integration of such data with other CEEMID data, or user-specific data.  While this approach makes sharing results more cumbersome, it provided a path to increase the number of useful indicators from a few dozens to around a thousand. Furthermore, it exponentially increases the value of CISAC&amp;rsquo;s, IFPI&amp;rsquo;s or EAO&amp;rsquo;s data, especially when designing better royalty rates, or creating economic evidence for litigation. Take a look at a simple, non-confidential example &lt;a href=&#34;https://danielantal.eu/post/cee_mini_17/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The CEEMID Music Professional Surveys are anonymous surveys about the live music and recording markets and granting schemes.  The surveys have been filled out by about 4000 musicians, technicians, managers (and 2000 filmmakers) about the tour destinations, concert budgets and average audiences, various royalty receipts from streaming services, physical and digital sales, YouTube, Bandcamp.  We are also creating comparable statistics with all EU national statistics on life satisfaction, economic expectations, income and economic situation and other characteristics of music and filmmaker professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CEEMID makes sure that the Client&amp;rsquo;s data (collective management organizations, music distributors, music export offices, music granting agencies) are correctly integrated with our survey data, statistical and big data sources, with industry data and the Client&amp;rsquo;s own transactional financial, licensing, granting or processed data. We are handling professionally data errors, missing data, currency translations and other problem areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;use-cases&#34;&gt;Use Cases&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In combination with collective management data and industry data the music professional surveys can help establish the value of certain rights, or estimate the compensation needed for home copying or the value transfer to platforms like YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In combination with granting data, it can be used for both ex ante evaluation to design better aimed, more cost-efficient and helpful grant calls, or to ex post evaluate the efficiency of grants and the (perceived) honesty and professionalism of the granting process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In combination with the anonymized State51 test data set, it can support machine learning and deep learning (AI) algorithms to establish the potential foreign markets of certain songs, artists or national repertoires, or asses the value of recordings to optimize promotion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My economic impact package, iotables, has a much updated released on CRAN</title>
      <link>/post/iotables_04/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 04 Jan 2019 19:00:00 +0100</pubDate>
      
      <guid>/post/iotables_04/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/108267715&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://zenodo.org/badge/108267715.svg&#34; alt=&#34;DOI&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This package was related to several of my works for Slovak, Hungarian and Croatian music industry and the Hungarian Film Fund, and my collaboration with Eeconomic impacT s.r.o in the Czech Republic. My R package downloads symmetric input-output and related tax, margins, use tables from the Eurostat bulk data warehouse, and organizes them for macroeconomic analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analytical functions of the package create the usual economic impact analysis, including direct effects, multipliers on gross value added, employment, CO2 or other factors. The package creates a programmatic interface to compare economic impact changes in time, or compare any country with any country in the European Union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The package is accompanied by three articles (or ‘vignettes’).  The &lt;a href=&#34;http://iotables.ceemid.eu/articles/germany_1990.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Germany 1990&lt;/a&gt; re-creataes almost all of the practical examples of the &lt;a href=&#34;http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/3859598/5902113/KS-RA-07-013-EN.PDF/b0b3d71e-3930-4442-94be-70b36cea9b39?version=1.0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Eurostat Manual of Supply, Use and Input-Output Tables&lt;/a&gt; by Jörg Beutel.  This may be used as a tutorial to input-ouput analysis or understanding the package interface. Furthermore, it creates as a verification tool in the package testthat infrastructure to make sure that the functions correctly return all published, verified examples by Prof. Beutel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://iotables.ceemid.eu/articles/united_kingdom_2010.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;United Kingdom Input-Output Analyitcal Tables&lt;/a&gt; article similarly recreates the analytical results, such as GVA and employment cost effects for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160114044923tf_/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/input-output/input-output-analytical-tables/2010/index.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;United Kingdom 2010&lt;/a&gt; table.  While the current UK tables and standard Eurstat tables are somewhat different, this table is accompanied by Richard Wild’s excellent article and published analytical results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;http://iotables.ceemid.eu/articles/working_with_eurostat.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Working with Eurostat data article&lt;/a&gt; shows how to work with real-life, current, SNA2010 compatible data from the Eurostat data warehouse. It contains some comparative results between Czechia and Slovakia.  The package is in itself is extending the functionality of the eurostat package, and it is released with eurostat in the rOpenGov community.&lt;/p&gt;
